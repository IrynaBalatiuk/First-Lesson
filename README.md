Hello Git! 

This is my first easy project in github. I understood for me that it's really importent to have your own page with open progets wich 
gives an access to code. 
About me: I'm graduated student from two university (Kharkiv - Ukraine and Lyon - France). Working in the field of testing. Have a lot of 
experience in manual testing and now moving into the scope of automated testing. Learning Python and 3D modeling.
